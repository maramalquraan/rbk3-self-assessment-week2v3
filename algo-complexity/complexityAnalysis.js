1- Constant O(1): describes an algorithm that will always execute in the same time regardless of the size of the input data set.
ex: determine if an integer is odd or even.

2- Linear O(n): describes an algorithm whose performance will grow linearly and in direct proportion to the size of the input data set.
ex: iterating over an unsorted array to find the max number.

3- Quadratic O(n^2): represents an algorithm whose performance is directly proportional to the square of the size of the input data set.
ex: bubble sort

4- Olog(n): The main idea here is not using the complete data, and reducing the problem size with every iteration.
ex: binary search.
